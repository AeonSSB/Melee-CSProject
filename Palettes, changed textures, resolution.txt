PALETTES

Some character costumes use palettes instead of textures for certain parts of the models.
The exact colours have been copied from HSDraw into very small .png images. Make sure to
edit them if the costume you want to render has custom palettes.

Those characters are:
- Ganondorf
  - The jewel on his front uses the Ambient palette of Object 24
  - His earrings use the Ambient palette of Object 37
  - His necklace uses the Ambient palette of Object 65
- Falco
  - The inner part of the jacket uses the Diffuse palette of Object 24


CHANGED TEXTURES

Melee uses extra textures for characters' expressions. All the images used by vanilla Melee
are included, but note that they don't share the same names and have to be picked manually
from the shader editor before rendering if they're needed.
In order to have more freedom with characters' expressions, some have Smash 2 textures set
up instead of Melee ones. In case you want to render a costume with elements like Fox's
eyes edited, you'll need to either remake the edits with the Smash 2 textures provided
or replace them with your own Melee textures.

[list characters that use Smash 2 textures; edit the text if Fox isn't one of these]


RESOLUTION

CSPs and stock icons are rendered both at a high resolution for HD textures and lower for
ISOs. If you need other specific resolutions make sure to edit them in the scenes themselves
before rendering.
