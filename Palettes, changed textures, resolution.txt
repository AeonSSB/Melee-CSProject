PALETTES

Some character costumes use palettes instead of textures for certain parts of the models.
The exact colours have been copied from HSDraw into very small .png images. Make sure to
edit them if the costume you want to render has custom palettes.

Examples:
- Ganondorf
  - The jewel on his front uses the Diffuse palette of Object 24
  - His earrings use the Diffuse palette of Object 37
  - His necklace uses the Diffuse palette of Object 65
- Falco
  - The inner part of the jacket uses the Diffuse palette of Object 24

Some characters' reflections are also controlled by palettes and tend to be edited across
costumes. Examples of this are Yoshi and Falco - although Falco uses the same hex for all
recolors in vanilla Melee, it's mainly something to consider with certain mods that change
the hex to compliment feather recolors.

The hex used in vanilla Melee are documented in each character's folder inside
"Scenes, Models, and Textures".
Palettes can also be used in extra ways to edit a costume, but that's something not covered
in these Blender scenes by default.


CHANGED TEXTURES

Melee uses extra textures for characters' expressions. All the images used by vanilla Melee
are included, but note that they don't share the same names and have to be picked manually
from the shader editor before rendering if they're needed.


RESOLUTION

CSPs and stock icons are rendered both at a high resolution for HD textures and lower for
ISOs. If you need other specific resolutions make sure to edit them in the scenes themselves
before rendering.
