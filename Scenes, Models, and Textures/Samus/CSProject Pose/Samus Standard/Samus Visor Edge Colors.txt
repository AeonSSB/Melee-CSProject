The texture for the visor's edges for Samus' Pink costume uses a colored texture to give its blue color. However, its materials
were set up incorrectly and were colored green instead of its intended color. Here are the hex codes for the visor edge colors.
Paste the hex colors in the custom property located in Samus' armature.
